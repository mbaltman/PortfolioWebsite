      <p> This was a collaboration with Jimmy of the art store <a href="https://patronsaint.shop/"> Patron Saint</a>. We created this game together for a Game Jam with the theme, Film.
        The prompt was to create a video game for a film that did not have one. This game is inspired by the 1986 film, Little Shop of Horror. All of the assets and art were created by
        Jimmy and all of the programming was done by me. Sound was sampled from ___ and ____. The original version of the game was created in 4 days, and the version you see here has
        been expanded on since then! </p>
