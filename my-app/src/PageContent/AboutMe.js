                I am a full stack developer with a passion for video game
                development. My favorite video game is Tetris. You can play
                my version of it here. For the last two years, I have worked
                at Typo*, a messaging app for creative teams. Working on a small
                team ( &lt; 10 people) has been incredibly rewarding and allowed me to
                get my hands dirty, working on every aspect of developing our backend
                and native macOS and iOS clients.

                My formal education in computer development was very much foundational
                and language agnostic. The benefit of that has been that it lets me jump
                between frameworks and languages relatively easily. I donâ€™t really care
                what the tool or the stack is. I just want to make beautiful and
                functional digital experiences.</p>
