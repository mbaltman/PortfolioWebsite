                <p> I am a full stack developer with a passion for video game
                    development. My favorite video game is Tetris. You can play
                    my version of it <a href="https://i.simmer.io/@altmanm/~2f70909f-0278-d816-201d-cc4c753283c0">here</a>.
                    For the last two years, I have worked
                    at <a href="https://typo.inc/">Typo*</a>, a messaging app for creative teams. Working on a small
                    team ( &lt; 10 people) has been incredibly rewarding and allowed me to
                    get my hands dirty, working on every aspect of developing our backend
                    and native macOS and iOS clients.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    My formal education in computer development was very much foundational
                    and language agnostic. The benefit of that has been that it lets me jump
                    between frameworks and languages relatively easily. I donâ€™t really care
                    what the tool or the stack is. I just want to make beautiful and
                    functional digital experiences. </p>
